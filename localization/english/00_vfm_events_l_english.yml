This mutual understanding stretches as far back as 1392, but changing [SCOPE.sCountry('kor_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] policy has led to the breakdown of this long friendship. What shall we do about [SCOPE.sCountry('kor_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] insubordination?"
  kor.4.a: "We shall put them in their place!"
  kor.4.b: "This issue is not worth spilling blood over."
