 je_swe_regency: "The Regency Era"
 je_swe_regency_reason: "Following the untimely passing of King Christian V in June 1826, Queen-Regent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], at the time only a month away from giving birth to #GOLD Gustav III#!, has become the de facto ruler of the United Kingdoms through the Regency Act. Yet, differing laws and views between the three Scandinavian kingdoms has led to dissatisfactions to the current arrangement given the Queen-Regent's perceived avoidance of political matter and foreign birth, and it is necessary that #GOLD Gustav III#! rise to the throne as soon as possible to maintain the union's stability.\n\n#bold As long as we are in the Regency era, we will suffer a penalty to our legitimacy, ability to enact laws, and integrating subjects.#!"

 scandinavian_events.1.d: "King [SCOPE.sCharacter('gustav_iii_scope').GetFirstName]'s coronation took place on [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString], in the #italic Storkyrkan#!. The young king, barely a young adult, ascended the throne with the procession witnessed by subjects all the way from Holstein to Karelen."
 scandinavian_events.1.f: ""The Almighty everlasting God pour out His Holy Spirit into your soul and mind, plans and undertakings, by whose gift may you so rule land and kingdom as to redound to the honour and glory of God, maintain justice and equity and be for the good of the land and people.""

 scandinavian_events.2.t: "The Scandinavian Succession"
 scandinavian_events.2.d: "The death of Gustav III has sent shockwaves throughout the empire, and our succession law dictates that Gustav III's uncle and Christian V's younger brother #bold Karl XI#! inherit the throne."
 scandinavian_events.2.f: "#bold Gustav III#! was a well-liked heir, but #bold Karl XI#! is an educated and experienced statesman whose ability to rule an empire is unquestioned. He will certainly bring back stability to the union."

 scandinavian_events.3.t: "An Earlier Coronation?"
 scandinavian_events.3.d: "The unpopularity of Queen-Regent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] in [SCOPE.sCountry('den_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('nor_scope').GetName] is proving to be one of the many sore points our subjects have with our rule. Given the increasingly troubled relations between the three kingdoms, our court suggests that [SCOPE.sCharacter('gustav_iii_scope').GetFirstName] should rise to the throne as soon as possible as a potential point for reconciliation."
 scandinavian_events.3.f: ""The Queen-Regent's refusal to visit [SCOPE.sCountry('den_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('nor_scope').GetName] and her reliance on Swedish advisors have strained our historical ties with the Swedish Crown. It's said she has little regard for the affairs of anyone but [SCOPE.sCountry('swe_scope').GetName]. And let's not forget the uprising in Vinland. We must find a way to communicate our concerns to Stockholm.""

 scandinavian_events.3.b: "The prince is not mature enough yet!"
