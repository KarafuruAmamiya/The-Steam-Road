 # Reconquer China

 je_reconquer_china_reason: "Following our victory over the Ming in 1757, we have managed to reconsolidate most of China under our rule. However, even now China is still not whole yet.\n\nIn #bold Guangdong#!, the Yue Kingdom have opened their market to the Europeans in hope of their protection. Meanwhile, the #bold Yunnan#! Kingdom have became a tributary of the Taungoos, though with the Taungoos' collapse in the horizon it will not last for much longer.\n\nWorst of them however is our rival, the #bold Bukharan Khaganate#!, who have subjugated the Nomadic Frontier while we were occupied with banishing the Ming, whose remnants has fled to #bold Hainan Island#!. If we were to prove that we possess the Mandate of Heaven, we must reconquer them no matter what."
