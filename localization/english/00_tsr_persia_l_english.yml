 persian_renaissance_science_philosophy_button_desc: "Long before the European Renaissance generated the radical ideas that eventually reshaped the West, Iranian statesmen, artists, and intellectuals had formulated ideas that strikingly anticipate those of modernity. However, these intellectual reforms encountered a widespread opposition from the court and the Ulemma. Now that our empire has embraced the possibility of another reform, let us encourage the new generation of intellectuals."

 persian_renaissance_romantic_nationalism_button: "Romantic Nationalism"
 persian_renaissance_romantic_nationalism_button_desc: "As nationalism continue to develop, the idea of an Iranian nation state became more and more widespread.

 persian_renaissance.1.t: "The Academy of Iran"
 persian_renaissance.1.d: "The literary movement developed in academic circles throughout the 19th century resulted in the establishment of the Academy of Iran (Farhangestân-e Iran), as the pioneering institution of its kind in the country. The mission of the Academy was to refine and preserve the Persian language and literature. It was established by the initiative of [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetFullName], and many prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time. "
 persian_renaissance.1.f: "The academy was a key institution in the struggle to build Iran as a nation-state. The academy led massive campaigns to replace the many Arabic, French, and Greek loanwords whose immense use in Persian during the previous centuries had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time."

 persian_renaissance.2.f: "At the beginning, the first floor of the museum was dedicated to the pre-Islamic era, and the second floor of the museum was dedicated to the post-Islamic era. However, the works of the Islamic era were officially separated from the museum and moved to the adjacent building, which was built a few decades later. This separated the museum into the Museum of Ancient Iran and the Museum of Islamic Archaeology and Art of Iran.\nThe Museum of Ancient Iran consists of two floors. Its halls contain artifacts and fossils from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, as well as the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, early and late Bronze Age, and Iron Ages I-III, through the Median, Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian eras.\nMeanwhile, the Museum of the Islamic era contains Islamic artifacts, with the second floor containing the early Islamic, Seljuq, and Ilkhanid periods while the first floor houses the holy Qurān hall, and artifacts of the Timurid, Zahedi, and Safavid periods."

 persian_renaissance.3.d: "Located on the eastern bank of the Tigris southeast of present-day Baghdad, Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the empires in the Parthian and Sasanian eras for over eight hundred years until the Muslim conquest of Persia. Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river. The city went into a rapid decline after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 760s, and soon became a ghost town."

After being captured by the Muslims, Susa recovered and remained a regional center of more than 400 hectares in size. In 1218, the city was razed by invading Mongols and was never able to regain its previous importance. The city further degraded in the 15th century when the majority of its population moved to Dezful."

 persian_renaissance.5.d: "Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire. It was constructed by Darius I and appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex that was only occupied seasonally, while the country's true capital remained in Susa. The city was destroyed by Alexander the Great and gradually declined in the course of time. The hometown of the Sasanian Dynasty, Estakhr, was found five kilometers north of Persepolis. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance, eclipsed by the new metropolis of Shiraz, and gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city."

 persian_renaissance.6.d: "The Atash Beram of Yazd has been burning since about 470 AD, originally started by a Sassanian Shah. From there it was transferred to Aqda where it was kept for 700 years. The fire was then moved in 1173 to Nahid-e Pars temple in Ardakan, where it remained for 300 years until it was moved again to the house of a high priest in Yazd.

 persian_flavor.1.f: "In the previous centuries, Safavid Shahs sought to compel Zoroastrians to accept Shia Islam or face persecution, imprisonment, exile, or be killed.
