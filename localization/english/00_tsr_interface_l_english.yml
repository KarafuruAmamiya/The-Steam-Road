 MIDDLE_EAST_LORE:0 "The Middle East in 1836"
 MIDDLE_EAST_DESC:0 "The suppression of the Revolution and the end of the Gunpowder Wars has brought a temporary peace to the world. But as time went on, it becomes clear that empires were not invulnerable to change, especially for the Gunpowder Empires of West Asia.\n\nIn the East, the Safavid Empire has enjoyed a period of calm, but it is clear that this peace will not last. The remnants of the revolution has resurfaced and take root among the people, especially those who had endured centuries of subjugation and oppression under the empire, while the Europeans have already consolidated themselves right on the empire's borders.\n\nMeanwhile, in the West, the Ottoman Empire has emerged as the dominant power in Eastern Europe following the Russian Empire's demise. But tensions among its subjects in Hungary, Romania, and Egypt threatened the unity of the empire. It is clear that major reforms are needed lest the empire collapse like the First Ottoman Empire had in the past.\n\nBetween the two empires lay the Ak Koyunlu Confederation, which has ruled Arabia and the Holy Cities in place of the Mamluks since the early 18th century. However, the Arab people are no longer satisfied by foreign rules, and Arab nationalism began to rise. The growing separatism among the subjects and the weakening of the central power from Diyarbakir makes the end of the confederation seem imminent.\n\nA great storm is brewing over the Near East as the Gunpowder League crumbled. The world hold its breath, waiting to see what will happen. Will the three empires survive intact, or will a new power rise from the ashes? Only time will tell."
