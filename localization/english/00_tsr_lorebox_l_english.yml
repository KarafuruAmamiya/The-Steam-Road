 MIDDLE_EAST_LORE:0 "The Middle East in 1836"
 MIDDLE_EAST_DESC:0 "Ever since the end of the Gunpowder Wars, the #bold Middle East#! has been in an uncertain peace for over five decades. With their main enemies, the Russian and Kaganid Empires gone, there was no longer any reason to maintain the Gunpowder Alliance. Nevertheless, the empires were more interested in maintaining the status quo.\n\nThe #bold Ottoman Empire#! in the west was an exception. Having recently entered a new age of prosperity, thanks in part to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the completion of the Suez Canal, they have emerged as the dominant power in Eastern Europe and seek to become the dominant Turkic state at the expense of their neighbor and former ally, the #bold Akkovin Confederation#!. That is, if they can get their increasingly disenchanted subjects under control first, especially in #bold Egypt#! where the Suez Canal is located.\n\nLed by the #bold Ak Koyunlu#! dynasty, the #bold Akkovin Confederation#! legitimized its rule by controlling the holy cities of Islam in #bold Hedjaz#! and declaring itself the defender of the Sunni faith. However, with the rise of new ideas such as nationalism, their Arab subjects are ready to challenge this and seek to establish their own sovereign state. Meanwhile, the lack of industrialization and modernization compared to their neighbors has left the Akkovins in the dust. If they don't attempt to reform their country soon, the fall of the empire seems all but guaranteed.\n\nTo the east, the #bold Safavid#! dynasty of #bold Persia#! was entering its 322nd year of rule since claiming the Persian throne in 1514. Eager to keep other empires, especially the Europeans, out of their sphere, the Safavids have recently adopted an interventionist policy toward their neighbors in Asia. However, only time will tell if they will succeed in their ambitions, as more and more Western powers assert their influence over the Orient. Meanwhile, the remnants of the 1720 Revolution are slowly resurfacing in Persia, while the reactionary factions are determined to do everything in their power to resist.\n\nThe clock continues to tick as a massive storm brews over the Middle East.\n"
 
 EUROPE_LORE:0 "Europe in 1836"
 EUROPE_DESC:0 "Ever since the passing of the 19th century, #bold Europe#! has settled into its latest status quo. The #bold French Empire#! has been the dominant power in Europe for centuries, and with colonies and puppets all over the world, it seems unlikely that this will change any time soon. Meanwhile, the #bold Kingdom of England#! has maintained an uneasy union with Scotland, who still hasn't forgotten the English invasion of 1709. On the North Sea coast, #bold the Netherlands#! has enjoyed decades of wealth and power thanks to its sprawling colonies in the New World, along with the jewel of the Dutch crown - the port of Edo.\n\nTo the north lay the #bold Scandinavian Empire#!, unified in 1806 when the Kingdom of Sweden merged its constitutions with those of its subjects, Norway and Denmark. Though eager to challenge French dominance in Europe, Scandinavia faces many problems at home with its rebellious colonies and its attempts to suppress the growing nationalist movements in its governorates. Below them lies the declining #bold Holy Roman Empire#!, led by the Askaniers of #bold Saxony#!. With the rise of German nationalism, the Empire's demise seems inevitable, but the Emperor is desperate to hold on to his title at all costs. To the east, the Poles and Lithuanians struggle to maintain their sovereignty in the face of powerful neighbors, while Ruthenia, once part of the Russian Empire, is divided between various grand duchies and resurgent Cossack hosts, all loyal to #bold the Ottomans#!.\n\nIn southern Europe, the Italians are still full of revolutionary fervor and revanchism after the end of the #bold Italian Revolution#! and their war of independence against France. However, with hostile monarchist neighbors on all sides, Italy must tread carefully lest they repeat Great Doge di Santini's mistakes. Meanwhile, #bold Aragon#! is making its last stand as #bold Iberia#! is poised to truly unite the peninsula. However there is the question of Southern Italy, and depending on their choices, the monarchs of Aragon may find themselves presented with a second chance. Iberia itself will have to manage its newfound empire and the ethnic groups within it carefully, as the Portuguese and Catalans, with centuries of independent history, will not be easily subjugated.\n\nThus began the Age of Steam in Europe. Will the status quo remain, or will new powers rise to replace the old?\n\n"
 
 ASIA_LORE:0 "The Far East in 1836"
 ASIA_DESC:0 "The landscape of the #bold Far East#! has changed drastically ever since the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1757. The #bold Liang Dynasty#!, founded by Yichen Ren, now rules China in its place. But China is still not whole. The #bold Bukharan Khaganate#! to the west has subjugated the Ming's former tributary states in Central Asia, in addition to taking over China's border regions when the Liang were still small and unstable. The #bold Yunnan Kingdom#! in the southwest allowed itself to become a tributary of the Taungoo for protection, but with the seemingly inevitable demise of the Taungoo at the hands of the Persians, this was bound to change. In Guangdong, the #bold Yue Kingdom#! has opened their markets to the Europeans, hoping for protection against the Liang. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Ming dynasty fled to #bold Hainan Island#!, hoping to one day reclaim their birthright.\n\nTo the east, the #bold Ashikaga Shogunate#! faces an existential catastrophe. As the northern daimyos fall one by one to the French, the end of the shogunate - and Japan - seems closer by the day. Meanwhile, the Jurchens, once united by Nurhaci, have once again fallen to foreign influence as religious differences tear them apart. To the south, the #bold Lan Xang#! kingdom has enjoyed a period of resurgence with the fall of its rivals Taungoo and Dai Viet, but only time will tell how long this will last as Western powers continue to encroach on Indochina.\n\nIn the East Indies, the situation is even more desperate. The #bold Kedah Sultanate#!, which once stretched from Cambodia to all of Sumatra and western Java, now lies in ruins as the #bold French East India Company#! tightens its grip on the region while its subjects, especially the Ayutthaya, plot their rebellion. Their main rivals, the #bold Ternate Sultanate#!, aren't much better off. While they have been more successful in defending themselves and keeping their subjects loyal, the constant pressure to defend the Spice Islands has led to their decline, and it's only a matter of time before all of Nusantara falls into foreign hands.\n\nWith most of Asia set to crumble, will the remaining powers retain their sovereignty, or will they too collapse in the face of imperialism?\n\n"
 
 NW_LORE:0 "The New World in 1836"
 NW_DESC:0 "Following the independence wars of the mid-18th century, the former colonies of European powers in the #bold New World#! are now free nations seeking to find their place in the world. In the eastern coasts of Laurentia, the #bold United States of Columbia#!, formerly the Twelve Colonies, are about to face their greatest challenge yet as they face not only the issue of slavery but also regional autonomy, Southern separatism, and competition with neighboring powers. West of the Mississippi, #bold Soalleiro#!, formerly the Viceroyalty of New Portugal, have begun industrializing and pushing the Western Frontiers, but as the gap in the wealth of its population grow, so does the potential for internal division. The #bold Karolean Federation#!, formerly the Viceroyalty of Vinland, must not only win their independence war but balance the tensions and demands of the the Vinlanders and Kanadese.\n\nMeanwhile, the #bold Lusitanian League#!, a loose union of former Portuguese colonies, face irrelevancy as their unity dwindles ever since the departure of their largest member Soalleiro and the Cispratine War. Among them, the #bold Aurelian Republic and New Aragon#!, formerly the Viceroyalty of Pacifico Oeste, are in the midst of rapid growth as their immigration policies and focus of pushing east began to bear fruit — if they can withstand their domineering neighbors. #bold The Antilles#!, once the richest of the former Portuguese colonies, must preserve the unity of their country or face collapse as each islands demand more and more autonomy. #bold Transplatina#!, barely recovering from the Cispratine War, are faced with the challenge of reclaiming #bold Cisplatina#! and #bold Juliana#! before they fall under foreign influence. #bold Marivia#!, birthplace of the League's founder, Rodrigo de Marialva, face the hefty task of reuniting the league while dealing with the increasing societal issues and poverty within their own country.\n\nWith the League weakened, their territories are ripe for picking by the colonial powers or rising powers such as the #bold Federal Republic of America#!, formerly the Viceroyalty of Santa Cruz. #bold Mexico#!, formerly the Viceroyalty of New Castile, are once again made a subject after promises of independence following the war with Iberia were broken by Soalleiro. On the other hand, with the rise of nationalism and political agitations, the remaining colonial powers in the New World saw their hold challenged, with the rise of independence movements in New Provence, Peru, New Wessex, Batavia, and others. What new order will rise in the Far West?"
