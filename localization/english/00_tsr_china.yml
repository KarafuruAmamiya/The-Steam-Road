 # Reconquer China

 je_reconquer_china_reason: "Following our victory over the Ming in 1757, we have managed to reconsolidate most of China under our rule. However, even now China is still not whole yet. In Guangdong, the Yue Kingdom have opened their market to the Europeans in hope of their protection. Meanwhile, the Yunnan Kingdom have became a tributary of the Taungoos, though with the Taungoos' collapse in the horizon it will not last for much longer. Worst of them however is our rival, the Bukharan Khaganate, who have subjugated the Nomadic Frontier while we were occupied. If we were to prove that we possess the Mandate of Heaven, we must reconquer them no matter what."
