 # Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation JE
 je_akkovin_crisis: "Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation"
 je_akkovin_crisis_reason: "Since the beginning of the 19th century, the Akkovin Confederation, the dominant political entity in Arabia, has been in an unprecedented decline. Lack of further modernization efforts, political instability, and increasing polarization has stunted our growth. Meanwhile, our Arabian subjects are undoubtedly biding their time to break free from our weakening hold. No matter what happens, we must avert the Confederation's demise."
 je_akkovin_crisis_goal: "Complete at least 8 of the 10 'Tanzimat' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 finished_reforms_tt: "Has completed the Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation [concept_journal_entry]"
 akkovin_fail_tt: "The Confederation no longer exists"
 western_clothes_tt: "We have adopted Western uniforms"
 no_arab_wars_tt: "We have finished the Rise of Arab Nationalism [concept_journal_entry]"
 treaty_of_baglar_tt: "This treaty marks the beginning of Persian enroachment into Akkovin internal affairs"
 no_baglar_treaty_tt: "We did not renew the Treaty of Baglar"
 no_renewing_baglar_tt: "#bold We may face backlash from the Persians! #!"
 je_akkovin_reform_advance: "Advances the Journal Entry 'Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation'"
 akturkification_start_tt: "We have take the "Promote Akturk Identity" decision"
 akturkification_over_tt: "The Akturkification Campaigns will end."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_economy: "Tanzimat: Economic Growth"
 je_akkovin_reform_economy_reason: "Our economy is largely agrarian and deeply rural. This suits the purposes of our conservative local Beys and Sanjaks as well as the clergy of the various milleti, who largely subsist on rents and fees extracted from peasants, it does not provide a suitable foundation for a modern power. We should expand manufacturing and our urban centres."
 je_akkovin_reform_economy_goal: "Double your GDP."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_education: "Tanzimat: Education Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_education_reason: "A principal problem facing our agenda of reform is the lack of educated and lettered men amoung our population. This stymies our efforts to create not only a modern economy and military, but also to break down the cultural barriers between our diverse population. This problem is especially accute in our Muslim subjects, leading to a Christian middle-class dominating economic life in many of our cities. The establishment of educational institutions and the growth of literacy must be a top priority."
 je_akkovin_reform_education_goal: "Increase the literacy rate of your people by 10%."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_army: "Tanzimat: Army Modernization"
 je_akkovin_reform_army_reason: "We must create a professional army and ensure its discipline holds, lest it contribute to internal unrest and undermine reform. We presently also rely heavily on Kurdish and tribal irregulars for garrison duty and the enforcement of our will throughout the Levant, however their brutality and fierce devotion to Islam is a hinderance as often as it is a help. Creating a disciplined, loyal and modern army will not be easy, but it will be worth it."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_navy: "Tanzimat: Naval Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_navy_reason: "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our earlier skirmishes in the Oriental Crisis, our navy threatened to defect to the Ottomans multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of foreign powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detatchments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."

 je_akkovin_reform_bureaucracy: "Tanzimat: Bureaucratic Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_bureaucracy_reason: "Our bureaucracy is a patchwork of archaic laws and systems, with corrupt, autonomous Beys barely exerting control over the Empire's provinces. If we are to overcome the many challenges to our rule, we must modernize our administrative system."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_sovereignty: "Tanzimat: Assert Our Sovereignity"
 je_akkovin_reform_sovereignty_reason: "The sad state of our country has emboldened both dissents within the country and intervention from foreign powers. To reclaim our place in the world stage, we must put them back in line."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish: "Tanzimat: Centralize Kurdish Lands"
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish_reason: "Ever since the Sultanate was established, we have relied on the Kurds to govern our territories and provide us manpower, in exchange of granting them a certain amount of autonomy. However, if we want to truly reform our administration, we must revoke these rights and gain complete control over our territories."
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"
 
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia: "Tanzimat: Rein in Arabia"
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia_reason: "Our rowdy subjects in Arabia has gotten increasingly daring in their efforts to dimnish our sovereignty. If the Confederation were to survive, we must put them back in their place no matter what."
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"
 
 je_akkovin_reform_minorities: "Tanzimat: Deal with the Dhimmi"
 je_akkovin_reform_minorities_reason: "As our decline continue, our non-Muslim subjects has become increasingly agitated in their movements to gain more rights and autonomy. To prevent separatism, we must reconsider some of our Dhimmi policies and either gain their loyalty or resort to force."
je_akkovin_reform_minorities_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"

je_akkovin_reform_nationalism: "Tanzimat: Promote National Identity"
 je_akkovin_reform_nationalism_reason: "One of the reasons for our decline is the lack of national cohesion within our diverse territories. In order to truly reform into a modern state we must create and promote a unified identity for our people, whether forcing our identity on them or promoting a shared, diverse, and secular identity."
 
 je_akkovin_partition_tur: "Partition of the Akkovin Sultanate"
 je_akkovin_partition_tur_reason: "The Akkovin Sultanate has decayed beyond saving. Let us restore order to the Akkovin anarchy!"
 je_akkovin_partition_per: "Partition of the Akkovin Sultanate"
 je_akkovin_partition_per_reason: "The Akkovin Sultanate has decayed beyond saving. Let us restore order to the Akkovin anarchy!"
 akkovin_partition_fail_tt: "We lost the Akkovin Partition War"
 
 # Akkovin Crisis Events
 akkovin_crisis.1.t: "Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation"
 akkovin_crisis.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of steady decline. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and put our subjects back in line, we risk catastrophe."
 akkovin_crisis.1.f: "Once part of the great Gunpowder Empires, the current state of our realm has made us the laughing stock of the Middle East. However, not all hope is lost. First, we must rid our military of all tribal structures and establish a truly modern military force. But in addition, we must catch up to at least the reforms of our neighbors in the Ottoman and Safavid Empires. Education, urbanization, and sovereignty shall be the top items of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] agenda."
 akkovin_crisis.1.a: "Great reform is needed."
 
 akkovin_crisis.2.t: "Collapse of the Akkovin Confederation"
 akkovin_crisis.2.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has failed to modernize and its subjects no longer acknowledged their rule. The vultures begin to circle as the last days of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] draw near."
 akkovin_crisis.2.f: "Diyarbakir falls silent. Just days after announcing [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetHerHis] intention to abdicate, most likely under the duress of [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetHerHis] ministers, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been found dead in [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetHerHis] chambers. Much like our precious sultanate, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] had been suffering from a long, creeping sickness that ultimately made [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetHerHim] unable to bear the weight of the crown. A broken and deranged shadow of [SCOPE.sCharacter('akkovin_sultan').GetHerHis] former self."
 akkovin_crisis.2.a: "We belong to Allah, and to Him do we return."
 
 akkovin_crisis.3.t: "Tanzimat: The Reorganization"
 akkovin_crisis.3.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 akkovin_crisis.3.f: "Sublime. That is the only word for it. To walk the streets of Diyarbakir and see modern factories and schools, to see the guards practicing their military drill. A landscape once dominated by peasant farmers is now littered with shining cities. And to think that only a few decades ago the sultanate was on the brink of collapse! Where once our neighbors looked upon us with pity and greedily sought to partition our lands, now we see their diplomats gazing in awe at our accomplishments, forced to recognize us as equals. God is good!"
 akkovin_crisis.3.a: "The army could use additional reforms."
 akkovin_crisis.3.b: "The Ottomans and Persians shall tremble in fear!"
 akkovin_crisis.3.c: "Follow through with urbanization."
 akkovin_crisis.3.d: "We will reap the benefits of education."

 akkovin_crisis.4.f: "Although our main enemies has fallen, our goal of maintaining power balance in the Middle East hasn't changed. However, the recent surge in nationalistic revolts by the Arabs along with our decaying neighbor, the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName], has threatened an upheaval right on our borders. If we let it be, the Ottomans, or worse, our Western rivals will certainly take advantage of the situation. Restoring order and maintaining the balance of power in the Middle East shall be the focus of our foreign policies."
 akkovin_crisis.4.a: "Let us propose a deal with the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName]."
 
 akkovin_crisis.5.t: "A Deal with the Safavids?"
 akkovin_crisis.5.d: "The Safavid Empire has proposed a deal to help with the unrest in the Confederation, in exchange for complete access to the Akkovin market."
 akkovin_crisis.5.f: "With the increasing tensions between us, the Ottomans, our Arab subjects, along with fears of Western intervention, the Safavids has taken an incentive to re-negotiate the terms of our trade agreement. However, it seemed quite obvious to us that they only want to take advantage of the unrest within the Confederation. Still, with a new alliance with the Safavids, fostered through the treaty's economic policy, we should receive help in curbing the rebels in Arabia before the Confederation collapses."
 akkovin_crisis.5.a: "Give us a week to think this through."
 
 akkovin_crisis.6.t: "The Treaty of Baglar"
 akkovin_crisis.6.d: "Signed in the district of Bağlar in Diyarbakir, the Treaty of Baglar is a formal trade agreement signed between the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName] and the [SCOPE.sCountry('per_scope').GetName], which stated that the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName] will abolish all monopolies, allow Persian merchants and their collaborators to establish private businesses with equal taxes to local merchants."
 akkovin_crisis.6.f: "Politically, the Treaty of Baglar is a statement that the [SCOPE.sCountry('per_scope').GetName] was heavily invested the future of the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName]. However, these agreements did not constitute an equal free trade arrangement, as the Safavids still employed protectionist policies on their agricultural markets, and the rapid influx of cheap Persian textiles and no protectionist policies would make industrializing a near impossible task for the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName]."
 akkovin_crisis.6.a: "What could possibly go wrong?"
 akkovin_crisis.6.b: "This shall serve our interests well."
 
 akkovin_crisis.7.t: "Renewing The Treaty of Bağlar"

In addition, the treaty demands the abolishment of the slave trade in the [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName], possibly to drive rising prices and more demand for Persian goods. To further their efforts, Persian propagandists has published and spread articles listing the benefits of free trade."

Considering the number of Kurdish tribes within the country, provoking a rebellion at our current state would potentially be disastrous, to say the least."
 akkovin_crisis.8.a: "We need to put them back in line."
 akkovin_crisis.8.b: "Give them what they want!"
 
 akkovin_crisis.9.t: "Collapse of the Akkovin Confederation"
 akkovin_crisis.9.d: "Once one of the dominant political entities in Arabia, the Akkovin Confederation is no more."
 akkovin_crisis.9.f: "As Eastern Anatolia descends to anarchy, it is clear that something needs to be done. Let us divide what remains of the Sultanate between ourselves and other Middle Eastern powers. This is also our chance to annex our claimed territories from the decaying [SCOPE.sCountry('akn_scope').GetName]."

While the rights and privileges of the Kurdish lords were guaranteed since the formation of the Sultanate in order to ensure their loyalty, times have changed.
