 MIDDLE_EAST_LORE:0 "The Middle East in 1836"
 MIDDLE_EAST_DESC:0 "Ever since the end of the Gunpowder Wars, the Middle East has been in an uncertain peace for over five decades. With their main enemies, the Russian and Kaganid Empires, gone, there was no longer any reason to maintain the Gunpowder Alliance. Nevertheless, the empires were more interested in maintaining the status quo.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire in the west was an exception. Having recently entered a new age of prosperity, thanks in part to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the completion of the Suez Canal, they have emerged as the dominant power in Eastern Europe and seek to become the dominant Turkic state at the expense of their neighbor and former ally, the Akkovin Empire. That is, if they can get their increasingly disenchanted subjects under control first, especially in Egypt where the Suez Canal is located.\n\nLed by the Ak Koyunlu dynasty, the Akkovin Empire legitimized its rule by controlling the holy cities of Islam in the Hedjaz and declaring itself the defender of the Sunni faith. However, with the rise of new ideas such as nationalism, their Arab subjects are ready to challenge this and seek to establish their own sovereign state. Meanwhile, the lack of industrialization and modernization compared to their neighbors has left the Akkovins in the dust. If they don't attempt to reform their country soon, the fall of the empire seems all but guaranteed.\n\nTo the East, the Safavid dynasty of Persia was entering its 322nd year of rule since claiming the Persian throne in 1514. Eager to keep other empires, especially the Europeans of the West, out of their sphere, the Safavids have recently adopted an interventionist policy toward their neighbors in Asia. However, only time will tell if they will succeed in their ambitions, as more and more Western powers assert their influence over the Orient. Meanwhile, the remnants of the 1720 Revolution are slowly resurfacing in Persia, while the reactionary factions are determined to do everything in their power to resist.\n\nThe clock continues to tick as a massive storm brews over the Middle East.\n\n"
