 # The Loss of Catalonia
 aragon_sicily.1.t: "The End of Aragon?"
 aragon_sicily.1.d: "With the loss of our ancestral lands in Iberia, the fate of the Kingdom of Aragon is put into question. Some believe that it is in our best interest to let go of Iberia and focus on what we have left in Italy, while others insist that we reclaim Aragon despite the seemingly overwhelming odds."
 aragon_sicily.1.f: "Tensions has been rising ever since our surrender to the so-called Iberian Empire. Although we are still full of revanchism to reclaim Aragon, our South Italian people do not seem to share the sentiment. With Italy having been goading their fellow Italians to revolt against us for decades, not listening to them will be a risky choice. However, by letting go of Aragon, we will be giving up our lands and our people in Iberia to the mercy of the Castilians."
 aragon_sicily.1.a: "We must reclaim Aragon!"
 aragon_sicily.1.b: "Aragon has fallen. We must look to the future."
 aragon_sicily.1.tt: "This may lead to our South Italian population revolting!"
