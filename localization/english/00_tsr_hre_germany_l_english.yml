 je_hre_falls_apart: "Crisis of the Holy Roman Empire"
 je_hre_falls_apart_reason: "Ever since the end of the Religious Wars, the Holy Roman Empire never returned to its former glory. Despite the efforts of the Saxon Emperors, they never managed to regain their authority. Now, not even our subjects believe in the legitimacy of the empire anymore, and the empire's demise seems to be right on the horizon. If we want to avert it, we must rein our subjects in, no matter what happen."

 hre.1.t: "End of the Holy Roman Empire"
 hre.1.d: "Kaiser [SCOPE.sCountry('sax_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] has abdicated his title and released all imperial states and officials from their oaths and obligations to the empire. Once the dominant entity in Central Europe since the coronation of Otto I in 962, the Holy Roman Empire is no more."
 hre.1.f: "Following protests in Germany and the chaos of the 1848 riots, the Emperor finally gave in to the demand of formally dissolving the empire. However, not all is glad that it was gone. Other than the German nationalists, the reactions within the former imperial boundaries are of rage, grief or shame. Even farmers are denying it, believing it to be a plot by the local authorities. Now, uncertainity looms over Germany. What will be of our homelands now?"
 hre.1.a: "May God help us all!"
 
 hre.2.t: "End of the Holy Roman Empire"
 hre.2.d: "Kaiser [SCOPE.sCountry('sax_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] has abdicated his title and released all imperial states and officials from their oaths and obligations to the empire. Once the dominant entity in Central Europe since the coronation of Otto I in 962, the Holy Roman Empire is no more."

 hre.4.t: "The South German Union"
 hre.4.d: "With the economic and political uncertainity following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, our South German neighbors wishes to enter an union with us."
 hre.4.f: "Today, we received diplomats from our neighbors in Württemberg, Ulm, Konstanz, Mulhouse, and Franconia about the possibility of merging into a single South German Union. Although this will help us solidify our position in South Germany, some of our politicians view that this move will only burden us and distract us from our ambitions."
 hre.4.a: "We will accept their offer"
 hre.4.b: "We don't need them!"

 je_reconquer_germany: "The Rückeroberung"
 je_reconquer_germany_reason: "For centuries many of our Germans brethrens have lived under foreign rule, subjugated during the chaos of the Religious Wars or the 18th century.

 je_reconquer_germany_status: "Reconquer Germany"
 
 german_events.1.t: "Beginning of the Rückeroberung"
 german_events.1.d: "Although we have unified Germany, the empire is still not whole. Many German lands are still in the hand of foreigners, and it is our duty to reclaim them."
 german_events.1.f: "The Rückeroberung, or "reconquest", was a series of military campaigns taken by the German Empire in the late 19th century to reclaim the territories lost by the Holy Roman Empire during the previous centuries. The campaigns was fueled by German nationalism, which demanded the return of all territories they saw as ethnically German to the German people."
 german_events.1.a: "Für das Vaterland!"
