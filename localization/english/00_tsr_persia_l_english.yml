Refusing to submit to them, King [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetFullName] still attempted to lead the resistance efforts. However, even he was captured and executed, while the rest of the Taungoos were exiled. We no longer have any choice but to submit to a puppet satrap of the Safavids.

There is no doubt that the Safavids see us as one of their next targets, and we must be prepared for what might happen."
