 # Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation JE
 je_akkovin_crisis: "Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation"
 je_akkovin_crisis_reason: "Since the beginning of the 19th century, the Akkovin Confederation, the dominant political entity in Arabia, has been in an unprecedented decline. Lack of further modernization efforts, political instability, and increasing polarization has stunted our growth. Meanwhile, our Arabian subjects are undoubtedly biding their time to break free from our weakening hold. No matter what happens, we must avert the Confederation's demise."
 je_akkovin_crisis_goal: "Complete at least 8 of the 1 'Tanzimat' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 finished_reforms_tt: "Has completed the Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation [concept_journal_entry]"
 akkovin_fail_tt: "The Confederation no longer exists"
 western_clothes_tt: "We have adopted Western uniforms"
 no_arab_wars_tt: "We have finished the Rise of Arab Nationalism [concept_journal_entry]"
 treaty_of_baglar_tt: "This treaty marks the beginning of Persian enroachment into Akkovin internal affairs"
 no_baglar_treaty_tt: "We did not renew the Treaty of Baglar"
 je_akkovin_reform_advance: "Advances the Journal Entry 'Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation'"
 
 je_akkovin_reform_economy: "Tanzimat: Economic Growth"
 je_akkovin_reform_economy_reason: "Our economy is largely agrarian and deeply rural. This suits the purposes of our conservative local Beys and Sanjaks as well as the clergy of the various milleti, who largely subsist on rents and fees extracted from peasants, it does not provide a suitable foundation for a modern power. We should expand manufacturing and our urban centres."
 je_akkovin_reform_economy_goal: "Double your GDP."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_education: "Tanzimat: Education Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_education_reason: "A principal problem facing our agenda of reform is the lack of educated and lettered men amoung our population. This stymies our efforts to create not only a modern economy and military, but also to break down the cultural barriers between our diverse population. This problem is especially accute in our Muslim subjects, leading to a Christian middle-class dominating economic life in many of our cities. The establishment of educational institutions and the growth of literacy must be a top priority."
 je_akkovin_reform_education_goal: "Increase the literacy rate of your people by 25%."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_army: "Tanzimat: Army Modernization"
 je_akkovin_reform_army_reason: "We must create a professional army and ensure its discipline holds, lest it contribute to internal unrest and undermine reform. We presently also rely heavily on Kurdish and tribal irregulars for garrison duty and the enforcement of our will throughout the Levant, however their brutality and fierce devotion to Islam is a hinderance as often as it is a help. Creating a disciplined, loyal and modern army will not be easy, but it will be worth it."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_navy: "Tanzimat: Naval Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_navy_reason: "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our earlier skirmishes in the Oriental Crisis, our navy threatened to defect to the Ottomans multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of foreign powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detatchments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."

 je_akkovin_reform_bureaucracy: "Tanzimat: Bureaucratic Reform"
 je_akkovin_reform_bureaucracy_reason: "Our bureaucracy is a patchwork of archaic laws and systems, with corrupt, autonomous Beys barely exerting control over the Empire's provinces. If we are to overcome the many challenges to our rule, we must modernize our administrative system."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_sovereignty: "Tanzimat: Assert Our Sovereignity"
 je_akkovin_reform_sovereignty_reason: "The sad state of our country has emboldened both dissents within the country and intervention from foreign powers. To reclaim our place in the world stage, we must put them back in line."
 
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish: "Tanzimat: Centralize Kurdish Lands"
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish_reason: "Ever since the Sultanate was established, we have relied on the Kurds to govern our territories and provide us manpower, in exchange of granting them a certain amount of autonomy. However, if we want to truly reform our administration, we must revoke these rights and gain complete control over our territories."
 je_akkovin_reform_kurdish_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"
 
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia: "Tanzimat: Rein in Arabia"
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia_reason: "Our rowdy subjects in Arabia has gotten increasingly daring in their efforts to dimnish our sovereignty. If the Confederation were to survive, we must put them back in their place no matter what."
 je_akkovin_reform_arabia_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"
 
 je_akkovin_reform_minorities: "Tanzimat: Deal with the Dhimmi"
 je_akkovin_reform_minorities_reason: "As our decline continue, our non-Muslim subjects has become increasingly agitated in their movements to gain more rights and autonomy. To prevent separatism, we must reconsider some of our Dhimmi policies and either gain their loyalty or resort to force."
je_akkovin_reform_minorities_goal: "The following must be true for 15 total years:"

je_akkovin_reform_nationalism: "Tanzimat: Promote National Identity"
 je_akkovin_reform_nationalism_reason: "One of the reasons for our decline is the lack of national cohesion within our diverse territories. In order to truly reform into a modern state, we must create and promote a unified identity for our people."
 
 # Akkovin Crisis Events
 akkovin_crisis.1.t: "Crisis of the Akkovin Confederation"
 akkovin_crisis.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of steady decline. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and put our subjects back in line, we risk catastrophe."
 akkovin_crisis.1.f: "Once part of the great Gunpowder Empires, the current state of our realm has made us the laughing stock of the Middle East. However, not all hope is lost. First, we must rid our military of all tribal structures and establish a truly modern military force. But in addition, we must catch up to at least the reforms of our neighbors in the Ottoman and Safavid Empires. Education, urbanization, and sovereignty shall be the top items of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] agenda."
 akkovin_crisis.1.a: "Great reform is needed."
 
 # Tanzimat Events
 tanzimat_events.1.t: "The Iltizām System"
 tanzimat_events.1.d: "For centuries our administration has depended on tax farming for collecting revenue, but this highly inefficient system leaves much to be desired. Proposals for reform have flooded the Grand Vizier's desk, and the nation eagerly awaits our response."
 tanzimat_events.1.f:1 "Ever since the reign of Ali IV, taxation rights have been auctioned off to the highest bidder, who in turn retain a part of the revenue for personal use. Over time, this has created a cadre of powerful, autonomous, and oftentimes corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting], significantly reducing state revenues.\n\nWhile most agree that the system must change, few agree on how, and fewer still want to antagonize the landholding elite."
 tanzimat_events.1.a: "Abolish tax farming, but leave the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting] in place."

 tanzimat_events.2.t: "An Akkovin Land Code"
 tanzimat_events.2.d: "Our existing system of land ownership is old, inconsistent, and in dire need of reform. Proponents of modernization demand action; how shall the High Porte respond?"
 tanzimat_events.2.f: "Land ownership in the Akkovin Confederation is a complicated affair, consisting of an overlapping patchwork of tenured and communal lands, tax-exempt villages, grants of conquest, and a slew of other land categories. Recognizing the current situation's negative impact on state administration and revenue, key figures in Diyarbakir push for reform. \n\nFearing conscription and increased taxation however, the country's rural population are sure to disapprove of any change to the status quo. "
 tanzimat_events.2.a: "Reform the system, but recognize traditional land categories."
 tanzimat_events.2.b: "The old system has served us well."

 tanzimat_events.4.d:1 "With our move towards a more professional bureaucratic system in motion, demands have been put forth to nominally elevate the legal status of non-Muslims, enabling them to serve as civil servants."
 tanzimat_events.4.f: "The preservation of the Confederation in the face of unrest, insurrection, and foreign intervention is a, if not the, primary concern of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. If we are to achieve this however, steps to appease our minority subjects might be necessary, lest they become pawns of malicious foreign powers."
 tanzimat_events.4.a: "Equal rights under the law! On paper at least."

 tanzimat_events.5.t: "Whispers of Insurrection"
 tanzimat_events.5.d:1 "A climate of paranoia has enveloped the city of [SCOPE.sState('paranoia_state_scope').GetCityHubName], after a local imam accused the [SCOPE.sReligion('discriminated_religion_scope').GetName] community of conspiring with [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] to undermine the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
 tanzimat_events.5.f: ""Are God's adversaries to be the equal of Islam? Some corrupt governors in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] may think so, but we true believers know better. As we speak, the unbelievers in our midst are busy plotting our doom, conspiring with their foreign masters to carve up our great empire like the confectioner carves up baklava.""
 tanzimat_events.5.a: "They are just rumors, right?"
 tanzimat_events.5.b: "Crack down hard on suspected traitors, better safe than sorry."
 tanzimat.5.tt1: "Radical Sunni voices might take matters into their own hand."

 tanzimat_events.6.f: ""They came following noon prayer, wielding sticks and clubs — no-doubt egged on by some militant local preacher. Only some bruises and material damage so far, thank God, but I do not like the look of that crowd over by the western gate.""
 tanzimat_events.6.a: "This is for the local governor to handle."
 tanzimat_events.6.b: "Muster the army, intervene immediately."

 tanzimat_events.7.t: "The [SCOPE.sState('massacre_state_scope').GetCityHubName] Massacre"
 tanzimat_events.7.d:1 "Horror! In a fit of merciless fury, a large crowd of [SCOPE.sReligion('sunni_religion').GetName] rioters have turned on their [SCOPE.sReligion('massacre_victims').GetName] neighbors. The streets of [SCOPE.sState('massacre_state_scope').GetCityHubName] run red with blood, and large parts of the city is ablaze."

 tanzimat_events.8.d: "A sense of normalcy has returned to the streets of [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetCityHubName]. Storefronts are being rebuilt and restocked, and statements of distrust and hatred are gradually being replaced with ones of reconciliation."
 tanzimat_events.8.f: ""The bastards ruined my store and insulted my name! But at the very least that was the extent of my injury. My son saw at least two of the men who partook in the riot dragged away by soldiers, apparently outed by their own community. Perhaps there is some justice to be found here after all. Now pass me the sugar, this tea is as bitter as uncured olives.""
 tanzimat_events.8.a: "Allah'a şükür!"

 tanzimat_events.9.t: "Peasants Resist Land Registration"

 tanzimat_events.9.f: ""For two hundred years my family has worked this land; paying our dues as we have according to tradition.

 tanzimat_events.10.f: "The Empire's non-Muslim subjects have traditionally been exempt from military service, substituting their blood with a special 'cizye' tax paid to the High Porte. Proponents of army modernization have now suggested the extension of the draft to all Akkovin subjects, however, this would rob the imperial coffers of an important source of income."
 tanzimat_events.10.a: "Those who can afford it may pay a draft exemption tax."
 tanzimat_events.10.b: "The draft applies to all subjects, regardless of creed."

 akkovin_flavor.3.t: "Centralising the Kurdish Regions"
 akkovin_flavor.3.d: "The proper governance of the realm concerns the Sultan greatly, as he would be seen as a wise and benevolent protector of the people. While the rights and privileges of the Kurdish lords were guaranteed since the formation of the Sultanate in order to ensure their loyalty, times have changed. A modern state requires a modern concept of territorial sovereignty, incompatible with the tribal organisation of the Kurds and their feudal relationship with the nation, as such we must restrict their territory and remove their autonomy."
 akkovin_flavor.3.f: "It is therefore with a glad heart and joyous tidings that the Sultan issues this firman to the Mirs of the tribe, inviting them to take up appointment under his Vali and thereby enrich the administration of the provinces"

 akkovin_flavor.4.t: "Creating a Kurdistan State"
 akkovin_flavor.4.d: "The Kurdish lords have long resisted centralisation and treated the Sultan more as an ally than a ruler. It may have suited us to entertain their internal feuds and raiding while our attention was on conquest and wars and their mountain homes inaccessible but times have changed, we will organise our Kurdish subjects into a single autonomous province and grant them limited self-rule in order to rationalise and reform the administration of the region, compelling them to unite under one ruler."
 akkovin_flavor.4.f: "In his wisdom, the Sultan confers upon the tribes of the mountains this grant of governenance, and decrees that they be governed hence as the following three provinces..."
 akkovin_flavor.4.a: "The Sultan is wise indeed."
 akkovin_flavor.4.a: "Glory to Kurdistan!"
 
 akkovin_flavor.5.t: "Creating an Armenian State"
 akkovin_flavor.5.d: "For long we have granted special rights to the Dhimmis in exchange for their loyalty and taxes, but it became clear such approach is not sustainable in the modern era. As such, we create a single autonomous state for our Christian subjects and grant them limited self-rule in order to rationalise and reform the administration of the region, compelling them to unite under one ruler."
 akkovin_flavor.5.f: "In his wisdom, the Sultan confers upon the non-Muslims this grant of governance, and decrees that they be governed hence as the following three provinces..."
 akkovin_flavor.5.a: "The Sultan is wise indeed."
