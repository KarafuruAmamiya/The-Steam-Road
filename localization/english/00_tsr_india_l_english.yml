 #Indian Flavor
 indian_flavor.1.t: "Bundelkhand Succession Crisis"
 indian_flavor.1.d: "A bitter news reaches Jhansi as Raja [SCOPE.sCharacter('gangadhar_rao_scope').GetFirstName] took his last breath. His consort [SCOPE.sCharacter('lakshmibai_scope').GetFirstName] is posed to take the throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Although his heir Damodar Rao has died earlier, he has adopted a child named Anand Rao who he renamed into Damodar Rao a day before his death. Yet, the Persians has rejected Damodar Rao's claim to the throne, and with the Doctrine of Lapse looming in the horizon, the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] looks bleak."
 indian_flavor.1.f: ""The death of him who is born is certain; and the rebirth of him who is dead is inevitable."" #Bhagavad Gita 2:27
 indian_flavor.1.a: "Long live the Rani!"
 
 indian_flavor.2.t: "Rani [SCOPE.sCharacter('lakshmibai_scope').GetFirstName]"
 indian_flavor.2.d: "With the death of Satrap Gangadhar Rao, [SCOPE.sCharacter('lakshmibai_scope').GetFirstName] has risen to the throne of [SCOPE.sCountry('bundelkhand_scope').GetName]. However, with the lack of a legitimate heir, we have the right to take over the satrapy directly through the Doctrine of Lapse. Despite this, the Rani demands that her adopted son [SCOPE.sCharacter('damodar_rao_scope').GetFirstName] be recognized as the heir of [SCOPE.sCountry('bundelkhand_scope').GetName]."
 indian_flavor.2.f: ""Main apni Bundelkhand nahi doongi!" (I shall not surrender my Bundelkhand!)"

 indian_flavor.2.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('damodar_rao_scope').GetFirstName] cannot inherit the satrapy!"
