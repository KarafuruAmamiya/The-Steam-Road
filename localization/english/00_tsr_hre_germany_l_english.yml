 je_hre_falls_apart: "Crisis of the Holy Roman Empire"
 je_hre_falls_apart_reason: "Ever since the end of the Religious Wars, the Holy Roman Empire never returned to its former glory. Despite the efforts of the Saxon Emperors, they never managed to regain their authority. Now, not even our subjects believe in the legitimacy of the empire anymore, and the empire's demise seems to be right on the horizon. If we want to avert it, we must rein our subjects in, no matter what happen."
 je_hre_falls_apart_status: "Rein in the Holy Roman Princes"
 hre_doesnt_exist: "The Holy Roman Empire does not exist"
 hre_complete_tt: "All princes in the Holy Roman Empire is our proper subject"
 hre_fail_tt: "No prince is in the Holy Roman Empire"
 
 hre.1.t: "End of the Holy Roman Empire"
 hre.1.d: "Kaiser [SCOPE.sCountry('sax_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] has abdicated his title and released all imperial states and officials from their oaths and obligations to the empire. Once the dominant entity in Central Europe since the coronation of Otto I in 962, the Holy Roman Empire is no more."
 hre.1.f: "Following protests in Germany and the chaos of the 1848 riots, the Emperor finally gave in to the demand of formally dissolving the empire. However, not all is glad that it was gone. Other than the German nationalists, the reactions within the former imperial boundaries are of rage, grief or shame. Even farmers are denying it, believing it to be a plot by the local authorities. Now, uncertainity looms over Germany. What will be of our homelands now?"
 hre.1.a: "May God help us all!"
