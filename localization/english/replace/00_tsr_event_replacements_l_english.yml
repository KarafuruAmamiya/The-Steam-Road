 tanzimat_events.1.t: "The Iltizām System"
 tanzimat_events.1.d: "For centuries our administration has depended on tax farming for collecting revenue, but this highly inefficient system leaves much to be desired. Proposals for reform have flooded the Grand Vizier's desk, and the nation eagerly awaits our response."
 tanzimat_events.1.f:1 "Ever since the reign of Ali IV, taxation rights have been auctioned off to the highest bidder, who in turn retain a part of the revenue for personal use. Over time, this has created a cadre of powerful, autonomous, and oftentimes corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting], significantly reducing state revenues.\n\nWhile most agree that the system must change, few agree on how, and fewer still want to antagonize the landholding elite."

 tanzimat_events.2.t: "An Akkovin Land Code"
 tanzimat_events.2.d: "Our existing system of land ownership is old, inconsistent, and in dire need of reform. Proponents of modernization demand action; how shall the High Porte respond?"
 tanzimat_events.2.f: "Land ownership in the Akkovin Confederation is a complicated affair, consisting of an overlapping patchwork of tenured and communal lands, tax-exempt villages, grants of conquest, and a slew of other land categories. Recognizing the current situation's negative impact on state administration and revenue, key figures in Diyarbakir push for reform. \n\nFearing conscription and increased taxation however, the country's rural population are sure to disapprove of any change to the status quo. "

 tanzimat_events.4.f: "The preservation of the Confederation in the face of unrest, insurrection, and foreign intervention is a, if not the, primary concern of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. If we are to achieve this however, steps to appease our minority subjects might be necessary, lest they become pawns of malicious foreign powers."

 tanzimat_events.5.d:1 "A climate of paranoia has enveloped the city of [SCOPE.sState('paranoia_state_scope').GetCityHubName], after a local imam accused the [SCOPE.sReligion('discriminated_religion_scope').GetName] community of conspiring with [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] to undermine the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
 tanzimat_events.5.f: ""Are God's adversaries to be the equal of Islam? Some corrupt governors in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] may think so, but we true believers know better. As we speak, the unbelievers in our midst are busy plotting our doom, conspiring with their foreign masters to carve up our great empire like the confectioner carves up baklava.""

 tanzimat_events.6.f: ""They came following noon prayer, wielding sticks and clubs — no-doubt egged on by some militant local preacher. Only some bruises and material damage so far, thank God, but I do not like the look of that crowd over by the western gate.""

 tanzimat_events.8.f: ""The bastards ruined my store and insulted my name! But at the very least that was the extent of my injury. My son saw at least two of the men who partook in the riot dragged away by soldiers, apparently outed by their own community. Perhaps there is some justice to be found here after all. Now pass me the sugar, this tea is as bitter as uncured olives.""

 tanzimat_events.9.f: ""For two hundred years my family has worked this land; paying our dues as we have according to tradition.

 tanzimat_events.10.d: "With the establishment of a military draft, the state must now decide the role, if any, of non-Muslims in our army."
 tanzimat_events.10.f: "Our non-Muslim subjects have traditionally been exempt from military service, substituting their blood with a special 'jizya' tax paid to the state. Proponents of army modernization have now suggested the extension of the draft to all subjects, however, this would rob our coffers of an important source of income."

The demand exists, and so we provide — if not us then some other nation would grow rich off the backs of [SCOPE.sCulture('opium_addicted_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] opium fiends.
